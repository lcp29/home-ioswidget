A lightweight utility app for displaying state data and performing operations for Home Assistant in a iOS widget.

You may use this project as a template. The states and services are tailored for my own use.

If the app **crashes at startup**, try investigating the app group ID in `HomeStore.swift` and compare with the app bundle ID in your side loading tool.
